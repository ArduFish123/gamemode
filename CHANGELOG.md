## 1.3

### Changes

* Disable screensaver when the game is running (can help when playing with gamepad or joystick).
* Add a `gamemoderun` helper script to do the necessary setup (set `LD_PRELOAD`) to enable GameMode on games which do not support it themselves.
* Support for overclocking on NVIDIA GPUs (experimental, use at your own risk). See `example/gamemode.ini` for further details.
* Support for configuring performance level on AMD GPUs (experimental, use at your own risk). See `example/gamemode.ini`.
* Increase I/O priority of game processes.
* `softrealtime` and `renice` options are no longer enabled by default since they require extra system configuration. See `example/gamemode.ini`.
* Add supervisor API which allows requesting GameMode on behalf of another process.
* Add tests for GameMode functionality (run with `gamemoded -t`).
* Various other minor fixes and improvements.
